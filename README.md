# AI-Powered Music Generation  

This project explores **AI-driven music generation** using deep learning techniques like **RNNs and GANs**. The goal is to create unique musical compositions by leveraging artificial intelligence.  

## Features  
- Generates original music using AI models  
- Utilizes deep learning frameworks for training  
- A creative and experimental approach to AI and music  

## Installation  
To set up the project, ensure you have **Python 3.10** installed. Then, install the required dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

## How to Use  
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the necessary cells to train the model or generate music.  

```bash
jupyter notebook music_generation.ipynb
```  

## Dependencies  
This project relies on the following key libraries:  
- **TensorFlow** â€“ for deep learning model implementation  
- **PyTorch** â€“ for alternative AI model training  
- **Music21** â€“ for processing and analyzing musical data  

A complete list of dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`.  

## About the Project  
This project explores how AI can be used for creative applications, particularly in music composition. It combines deep learning with music theory to generate unique, AI-crafted melodies.
